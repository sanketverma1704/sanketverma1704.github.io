### Hi everyone! 👋

Recently, I revamped my personal website and hosted it on a new domain,
[sanketverma.com](https://sanketverma.com/). I'll be posting new stuff,
including blogs, updates, adventures, etc., here.

I've also changed my username across the web.  Earlier, I used to go by
`MSanKeys963`, but now you can find me on the internet by:

### 🥁 `sanketverma1704` 🥁

Here are the few places you can find me using the new handle:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/sanketverma1704/)
- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sanketverma1704.bsky.social)
- [Twitter](https://x.com/sanketverma1704/)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sanketverma1704/)
- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/sanketverma1704/)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@sanketverma1704/)

I still own my old username across various platforms, and have added a redirect
message to my profile bio. If you find an account with my old username, that
mostly means that I've stopped using that website and would need to set up a
redirect or _maybe_ delete that account.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you find something which looks like me
but isn't me. ;)

Peace! ✌🏻
