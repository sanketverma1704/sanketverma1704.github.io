I’m a software engineer deeply invested in the open-source scientific
ecosystem. I love working with OS communities and contributing to various
projects. I wear multiple hats in the open-source software world — writing
code, creating processes and workflows, steering various committees, organising
technical meet-ups and global conferences, and many more.

Apart from open-source, I’ve worked in R&D and data science roles with various
organisations, startups, and the Government of India. Check my
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sanketverma1704/) for more.

When I’m not working, you can find me trekking in the Himalayas. Mountains are
my second favourite thing, right after computers. I also play video games,
watch movies, play football and run marathons.

## Community Leadership

I've been organising meet-ups and conferences almost for a decade! It's one of
the  ways how I give back to the community which has been super helpful in my
journey.
