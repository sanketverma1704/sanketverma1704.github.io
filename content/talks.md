Recently, I've been speaking about [Zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/)
(as it's one of the projects I work with) and best practices on how to foster a
healthy and vibrant open-source community. I also talk about machine learning
and data science occasionally.

I keep my presentations and other associated materials in a GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/sanketverma1704/presentations). Here is the
list of the talks I've given throughout the years.
